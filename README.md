ðŸ”§ Customization

    # Add more categories as needed
}
Important Notes

Backup First: Consider backing up important files before running
Path Format: Use absolute paths for best results
Permissions: Ensure you have read/write permissions for the target directory
Nested Files: The script only organizes files in the root of the target directory

Troubleshooting

Solution: Verify the path is correct and accessible

Issue: "Permission denied"

Solution: Run with administrator/sudo privileges or check folder permissions

Issue: Files not moving

Solution: Check the log file for specific error messages
